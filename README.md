Network Anlysis and Security Labs

Hello, my name is Federico.
In this repository you will find all the practical excersices that I did to gain hands-on experience with the most common tools used in network administration and security.

The other branch, GymLog, is a website that I designed as the final project for the CS50x Intoduction to Computer Science Harvard's course.
