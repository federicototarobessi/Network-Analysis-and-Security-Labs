Wireshark: Packet Operations

Activity description: This laboratory focuses on advanced packet manipulation and analysis. The objective was to master the use of statistical tools to gain a high-level overview of network traffic and to apply complex filtering principles to isolate specific communication strings.

Tools used: Wireshark Packet Analyser, Virtual Machine (VM) Environment, Network Traffic Captures (.pcap files).

Methodology:
1. Statistics and Network Overview I utilized the Statistics menu to analyze the overall scope of the capture. This included investigating Protocol Hierarchy, Endpoints, and Conversations to identify the most active participants in the network. I specifically practiced investigating IP addresses, DNS packets, and identifying frequent HTTP requests.
2. Advanced Packet Filtering I practiced the syntax for both Capture Filters and Display Filters. Using the Display Filter Expression builder, I created complex filters combining comparison and logical operators. Key tasks included filtering traffic by TTL values, specific port numbers, and isolating packets based on layered protocol criteria.
3. Protocol Analysis The activity involved uncovering specific details within protocols by applying advanced filters to see the "big picture" of a conversation, allowing for the correlation of disparate packets into a single logical stream of data.

Lessons Learned I learned how to use the statistics menu to quickly identify anomalies in traffic volume and protocol distribution. I mastered the use of logical operators to build advanced display filters, significantly reducing the time required to find specific data points. Additionally, I improved my ability to navigate complex conversations by understanding the relationship between endpoints and their requested services.
